We perform a complete analysis of the dimension six modifications of the top coupling to gluons and find that cancellations among operators in the t ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} rate allow for very low compositeness scales, but this can be drastically improved by looking at kinematic distributions. Turning to the LHC, we examine four top production from a dimension six four-top operator and estimate the LHC with 100 fb −1 collected luminosity to be sensitive to compositeness scales as high as 5 TeV.}

These particles may arise as light bound states of a fundamental dynamics giving rise to a composite Higgs boson and partial compositeness for the top. As a concrete example, we discuss an explicit UV completion based on the SU(4)/Sp(4) coset, where QCD colour is carried by additional fundamental fermions charged under the confining gauge group. Top partners, as well as potentially even lighter coloured scalars, arise as bound states of the coloured fermions. We study production and detection at LHC Run I and II of the octet and sextet, setting lower limits on masses and couplings to Standard Model particles using existing 8 TeV analyses. We finally explore prospects for the ongoing 13 TeV Run II: we focus on final states with two same sign leptons, that have the potential to discriminate the sextet.",

abstract="Studies of dark matter lie at the interface of collider physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Constraining models featuring dark matter candidates entails the capability to provide accurate predictions for large sets of observables and compare them to a wide spectrum of data. We present a framework which, starting from a model Lagrangian, allows one to consistently and systematically make predictions, as well as to confront those predictions with a multitude of experimental results. As an application, we consider a class of simplified dark matter models where a scalar mediator couples only to the top quark and a fermionic dark sector (i.e. the simplified top-philic dark matter model). We study in detail the complementarity of relic density, direct/indirect detection and collider searches in constraining the multi-dimensional model parameter space, and efficiently identify regions where individual approaches to dark matter detection provide the most stringent bounds. In the context of collider studies of dark matter, we point out the complementarity of LHC searches in probing different regions of the model parameter space with final states involving top quarks, photons, jets and/or missing energy. Our study of dark matter production at the LHC goes beyond the tree-level approximation and we show examples of how higher-order corrections to dark matter production processes can affect the interpretation of the experimental results.",

  abstract={This document proposes a collection of simplified models relevant to the design of new-physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the characterization of their results. Both ATLAS and CMS have already presented some results in terms of simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified models can equally well be described by a small number of masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly related to collider physics observables, making simplified models a particularly effective framework for evaluating searches and a useful starting point for characterizing positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an official summary of the results from the ‘Topologies for Early LHC Searches’ workshop, held at SLAC in September of 2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of representative models that can be used to cover all relevant phase space in experimental searches. Particular emphasis is placed on searches relevant for the first ∼50–500 pb −1 of data and those motivated by supersymmetric models. This note largely summarizes material posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes simplified model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting contacts within the theory community. We also comment on future developments that may be useful as more data is gathered and analyzed by the experiments.}

  abstract={The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

SketchUp provides a Ruby API which we use to interface with the CMS Detector Description to create 3D models of the CMS detector. With the Ruby API, we also have created an interface to the JSON-based event format used for the iSpy event display to create 3D models of CMS events. These models have many applications related to 3D representation of the CMS detector and events. Figures produced based on these models were used in conference presentations, journal publications, technical design reports for the detector upgrades, art projects, outreach programs, and other presentations.}

  abstract={I describe a framework for the presentation of search results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CL s technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

The measurements are performed in events with two leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state. Results of the cross section measurement in events with and without b-quark identification are obtained and combined. The measured value is = 168 �� 18 (stat . ) �� 14 (syst . ) �� 7 (lumi . ) pb, consistent with predictions from the standard model. The top quark mass m top is reconstructed with two different methods, a full kinematic analysis and a matrix weighting technique. The combination yields a measurement of m top = 175 . 5 �� 4 . 6 (stat . ) �� 4 . 6 (syst.) GeV/ c 2 .}}

  abstract={A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction vertices. Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent. For t ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} events under typical 2011 pileup conditions, the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of p T > 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |η| < 0.9 and 85% for 0.9 < |η| < 2.5. The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%. For isolated muons of p T  = 100GeV emitted at |η| < 1.4, the resolutions are approximately 2.8% in p T , and respectively, 10μm and 30μm in the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters. The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp collisions is 10–12μm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible, and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}

We will discuss some of the new features that have been added since 2006 as well as some of the problems that have been addressed. Also discussed is the level of adoption throughout CMS, which spans the trigger farm up to the final physics analysis. Future plans, in particular dealing with schema evolution and scaling, will be discussed briefly.}

Because of the significant CPU consumption of this algorithm, it can, however, only be run on a limited number of candidates. The standard GSF electron track reconstruction is triggered by the presence of high energy isolated electromagnetic clusters, but it is not suited for electrons in jets (usually soft and not isolated). A pre-identification algorithm based on both the tracker and the calorimeter, was therefore recently developed. It allows electron tracks within jets to be efficiently reconstructed even for small electron transverse momentum. This algorithm as well as its performance in terms of efficiency, mis-identification probability are presented.}

  abstract = {The performance of muon reconstruction, identification, and triggering in CMShas been studied using 40 inverse picobarns of data collected in pp collisionsat sqrt(s) = 7 TeV at the LHC in 2010. A few benchmark sets of selectioncriteria covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined.For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify amuon with a transverse momentum pT larger than a few GeV is above 95% over thewhole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system, abs(eta)<2.4,while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%. Theefficiency to trigger on single muons with pT above a few GeV is higher than90% over the full eta range, and typically substantially better. The overallmomentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays. Thetransverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on pseudorapidityfor muons with pT below 100 GeV and, using cosmic rays, it is shown to bebetter than 10% in the central region up to pT = 1 TeV. Observed distributionsof all quantities are well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}

We examine some properties of a newmember of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-k_t''algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jetswith only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal,the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those ofa rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these propertieshold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithmswith split--merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifyingcharacteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, forwhich the anti-k_t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinearsafe replacement.}

The results arepresented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-basedapproach, the "Jet-Plus-Track" approach, which improves the measurement ofcalorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the "Particle Flow"approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in theevent, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevantsubdetectors.}

The second approach is based on multivariate analysistechniques that probe the compatibility of the candidate events with thesignal. Data have been collected for the muon and electron final states,corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.17 and 1.56 inverse femtobarns,respectively.

abstract="We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.",

abstract="MadGraph 5 is the new version of the MadGraph matrix element generator, written in the Python programming language. It implements a number of new, efficient algorithms that provide improved performance and functionality in all aspects of the program. It features a new user interface, several new output formats including C++ process libraries for Pythia 8, and full compatibility with FeynRules for new physics models implementation, allowing for event generation for any model that can be written in the form of a Lagrangian. MadGraph 5 builds on the same philosophy as the previous versions, and its design allows it to be used as a collaborative platform where theoretical, phenomenological and simulation projects can be developed and then distributed to the high-energy community. We describe the ideas and the most important developments of the code and illustrate its capabilities through a few simple phenomenological examples.",

abstract="We discuss the theoretical bases that underpin the automation of the computations of tree-level and next-to-leading order cross sections, of their matching to parton shower simulations, and of the merging of matched samples that differ by light-parton multiplicities. We present a computer program, MadGraph5 aMC@NLO, capable of handling all these computations --- parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged --- in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV e                +                e                − collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.",

Themethod has the following features: fully exclusive events are generated, withhadronization according to the MC model; total exclusive rates are accurate toNLO; NLO results for distributions are recovered upon expansion in $\alpha_S$;hard emissions are treated as in NLO computations while soft/collinearemissions are handled by the MC simulation, with the same logarithmic accuracyas the MC; and matching between the hard- and soft/collinear-emission regionsis smooth. A fraction of events with negative weight is generated, butunweighting remains possible with reasonable efficiency. The method isclarified using a simple toy model, and illustrated by application to thehadroproduction of W$^+$W$^-$ pairs.}

A regularizationmethod for unfolding these distributions is re-formulated in terms of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the response matrix. A relatively simple,yet quite efficient unfolding procedure is explained in detail. The conciselinear algorithm results in a straightforward implementation with full errorpropagation, including the complete covariance matrix and its inverse. Severalimprovements upon widely used procedures are proposed, and recommendations aregiven how to simplify the task by the proper choice of the matrix. Ways ofdetermining the optimal value of the regularization parameter are suggested anddiscussed, and several examples illustrating the use of the method arepresented.}

  abstract = {We present an online measurement of the LHC beamspot parameters in ATLAS using the High Level Trigger (HLT). When a significant change is detected in the measured beamspot, it is distributed to the HLT. There, trigger algorithms like b-tagging which calculate impact parameters or decay lengths benefit from a precise, up-to-date set of beamspot parameters. Additionally, online feedback is sent to the LHC operators in real time. The measurement is performed by an algorithm running on the Level 2 trigger farm, leveraging the high rate of usable events. Dedicated algorithms perform a full scan of the silicon detector to reconstruct event vertices from registered tracks. The distribution of these vertices is aggregated across the farm and their shape is extracted through fits every 60 seconds to determine the beamspot position, size, and tilt. The reconstructed beamspot values are corrected for detector resolution effects, measured in situ using the separation of vertices whose tracks have been split into two collections. Furthermore, measurements for individual bunch crossings have allowed for studies of single-bunch distributions as well as the behavior of bunch trains. This talk will cover the constraints imposed by the online environment and describe how these measurements are accomplished with the given resources. The algorithm tasks must be completed within the time constraints of the Level 2 trigger, with limited CPU and bandwidth allocations. This places an emphasis on efficient algorithm design and the minimization of data requests.}

  abstract = {The first level trigger of the CMS experiment is comprised of customelectronics that process data from the electromagnetic and hadron calorimetersand three technologies of muon detectors in order to select the mostinteresting events from LHC collisions, such as those consistent with theproduction and decay of the Higgs boson. The rate of events selected by thisLevel-1 trigger must be reduced from the beam crossing frequency to no morethan 100 kHz further processing can occur, a major challenge since the LHCinstantaneous luminosity has increased by six orders of magnitude since thestart of operations to more than 6E33 cm-2s-1 today. The performance of theLevel-1 trigger, in terms of rates and efficiencies of the main objects andtrigger algorithms, as measured from LHC proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeVcenter-of-mass energies is presented here.}

The t t-bar differential cross section ismeasured as a function of kinematic properties of the final-state chargedleptons and jets associated to b quarks, as well as those of the top quarks andthe t t-bar system. The data are compared with several predictions fromperturbative QCD calculations up to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-orderprecision.

We summarize the current experimental situation andthe status of the theoretical evaluations. An estimate of the currenttheoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-order corrections and from theexperimental errors of the input parameters is given. We discuss futureprospects for both the experimental accuracies and the precision of thetheoretical predictions. Confronting the precision data with the theorypredictions within the unconstrained MSSM and within specific SUSY-breakingscenarios, we analyse how well the data are described by the theory. The mSUGRAscenario with cosmological constraints yields a very good fit to the data,showing a clear preference for a relatively light mass scale of the SUSYparticles. The constraints on the parameter space from the precision data isdiscussed, and it is shown that the prospective accuracy at the next generationof colliders will enhance the sensitivity of the precision tests verysignificantly.}

The ttbar system is reconstructed using both small-radius andlarge-radius jets, the latter being supplemented by a jet substructureanalysis.

No evidence for a ttbar resonance is found and 95% credibility-levellimits on the production rate are determined for massive states predicted intwo benchmark models. The upper limits on the cross section times branchingratio of a narrow Z' resonance range from 5.1 pb for a boson mass of 0.5 TeV to0.03 pb for a mass of 3 TeV. A narrow leptophobic topcolor Z' resonance with amass below 1.74 TeV is excluded. Limits are also derived for a broadcolor-octet resonance with Gamma/m = 15.3%.

Thelower limit is set by neutrino oscillations and the fact that masses arenon-negative. The upper limit is set by laboratory measurements on the betadecay of tritium. These determinations share a common characteristic of beingessentially model independent, or "direct." The clustering on large scales inthe universe depends on this quantity, and, within the framework of Lambda-CDMcosmology, favors a mass sum below about 600 meV. In this article, thelaboratory approach to neutrino mass via beta decay is emphasized, particularlyan experiment now under construction, KATRIN, on the beta decay of tritium.Another candidate beta-active nuclide, Re-187, offers an advantage in phasespace but calls for a very different experimental approach.}

  abstract={The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}
