  abstract={The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

SketchUp provides a Ruby API which we use to interface with the CMS Detector Description to create 3D models of the CMS detector. With the Ruby API, we also have created an interface to the JSON-based event format used for the iSpy event display to create 3D models of CMS events. These models have many applications related to 3D representation of the CMS detector and events. Figures produced based on these models were used in conference presentations, journal publications, technical design reports for the detector upgrades, art projects, outreach programs, and other presentations.}

  abstract={I describe a framework for the presentation of search results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CL s technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

  abstract = {{The production cross section and top quark mass are measured in proton-proton collisions at TeV in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb ���1 collected by the CMS experiment. The measurements are performed in events with two leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state. Results of the cross section measurement in events with and without b-quark identification are obtained and combined. The measured value is = 168 �� 18 (stat . ) �� 14 (syst . ) �� 7 (lumi . ) pb, consistent with predictions from the standard model. The top quark mass m top is reconstructed with two different methods, a full kinematic analysis and a matrix weighting technique. The combination yields a measurement of m top = 175 . 5 �� 4 . 6 (stat . ) �� 4 . 6 (syst.) GeV/ c 2 .}}

  abstract={A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction vertices. Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent. For t ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} events under typical 2011 pileup conditions, the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of p T > 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |η| < 0.9 and 85% for 0.9 < |η| < 2.5. The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%. For isolated muons of p T  = 100GeV emitted at |η| < 1.4, the resolutions are approximately 2.8% in p T , and respectively, 10μm and 30μm in the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters. The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp collisions is 10–12μm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible, and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}

  abstract = {In the CMS software, a dedicated electron track reconstruction algorithm, based on a Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF), is used. This algorithm is able to follow an electron along its complete path up to the electromagnetic calorimeter, even in the case of a large amount of Bremsstrahlung emission. Because of the significant CPU consumption of this algorithm, it can, however, only be run on a limited number of candidates. The standard GSF electron track reconstruction is triggered by the presence of high energy isolated electromagnetic clusters, but it is not suited for electrons in jets (usually soft and not isolated). A pre-identification algorithm based on both the tracker and the calorimeter, was therefore recently developed. It allows electron tracks within jets to be efficiently reconstructed even for small electron transverse momentum. This algorithm as well as its performance in terms of efficiency, mis-identification probability are presented.}

A few benchmark sets of selectioncriteria covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined.For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify amuon with a transverse momentum pT larger than a few GeV is above 95% over thewhole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system, abs(eta)<2.4,while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%. Theefficiency to trigger on single muons with pT above a few GeV is higher than90% over the full eta range, and typically substantially better. The overallmomentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays. Thetransverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on pseudorapidityfor muons with pT below 100 GeV and, using cosmic rays, it is shown to bebetter than 10% in the central region up to pT = 1 TeV. Observed distributionsof all quantities are well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}

We examine some properties of a newmember of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-k_t''algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jetswith only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal,the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those ofa rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these propertieshold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithmswith split--merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifyingcharacteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, forwhich the anti-k_t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinearsafe replacement.}

The second approach is based on multivariate analysistechniques that probe the compatibility of the candidate events with thesignal. Data have been collected for the muon and electron final states,corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.17 and 1.56 inverse femtobarns,respectively.

NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.",

abstract="We discuss the theoretical bases that underpin the automation of the computations of tree-level and next-to-leading order cross sections, of their matching to parton shower simulations, and of the merging of matched samples that differ by light-parton multiplicities. We present a computer program, MadGraph5 aMC@NLO, capable of handling all these computations --- parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged --- in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV e                +                e                − collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.",

A fraction of events with negative weight is generated, butunweighting remains possible with reasonable efficiency. The method isclarified using a simple toy model, and illustrated by application to thehadroproduction of W$^+$W$^-$ pairs.}

A regularizationmethod for unfolding these distributions is re-formulated in terms of theSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the response matrix. A relatively simple,yet quite efficient unfolding procedure is explained in detail. The conciselinear algorithm results in a straightforward implementation with full errorpropagation, including the complete covariance matrix and its inverse. Severalimprovements upon widely used procedures are proposed, and recommendations aregiven how to simplify the task by the proper choice of the matrix. Ways ofdetermining the optimal value of the regularization parameter are suggested anddiscussed, and several examples illustrating the use of the method arepresented.}

Additionally, online feedback is sent to the LHC operators in real time. The measurement is performed by an algorithm running on the Level 2 trigger farm, leveraging the high rate of usable events. Dedicated algorithms perform a full scan of the silicon detector to reconstruct event vertices from registered tracks. The distribution of these vertices is aggregated across the farm and their shape is extracted through fits every 60 seconds to determine the beamspot position, size, and tilt. The reconstructed beamspot values are corrected for detector resolution effects, measured in situ using the separation of vertices whose tracks have been split into two collections. Furthermore, measurements for individual bunch crossings have allowed for studies of single-bunch distributions as well as the behavior of bunch trains. This talk will cover the constraints imposed by the online environment and describe how these measurements are accomplished with the given resources. The algorithm tasks must be completed within the time constraints of the Level 2 trigger, with limited CPU and bandwidth allocations. This places an emphasis on efficient algorithm design and the minimization of data requests.}

A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS toselect b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters ofcharged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, andthe presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performanceof these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisionsat the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used inthis study were recorded in 2011 at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV for a total integratedluminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns. The efficiency for tagging b-quark jetshas been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS hasachieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentificationprobability of 10%. For analyses requiring higher purity, a misidentificationprobability of only 1.5% has been achieved, for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency.}

We summarize the current experimental situation andthe status of the theoretical evaluations. An estimate of the currenttheoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-order corrections and from theexperimental errors of the input parameters is given. We discuss futureprospects for both the experimental accuracies and the precision of thetheoretical predictions. Confronting the precision data with the theorypredictions within the unconstrained MSSM and within specific SUSY-breakingscenarios, we analyse how well the data are described by the theory. The mSUGRAscenario with cosmological constraints yields a very good fit to the data,showing a clear preference for a relatively light mass scale of the SUSYparticles. The constraints on the parameter space from the precision data isdiscussed, and it is shown that the prospective accuracy at the next generationof colliders will enhance the sensitivity of the precision tests verysignificantly.}

These determinations share a common characteristic of beingessentially model independent, or "direct." The clustering on large scales inthe universe depends on this quantity, and, within the framework of Lambda-CDMcosmology, favors a mass sum below about 600 meV.
