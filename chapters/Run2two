\section{Comparison of the Gradient Boost and AdaBoost boosting algorithms within the BDT \label{app:adagrad}}

For this study, we trained 3 BDTs using the following strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gradient boosting taking into account negative weighting information in training and testing
\item Gradient boosting ignoring negative weighting information in training and testing
\item AdaBoost boosting ignoring negative weighting information in training and testing
\end{enumerate}
It was decided that if we were going to ignore the negative weight information then there was no reason to not include these events in the training sample. Additionally, if one was to ignore the negative weight information then there is no reason to not examine using AdaBoost.  Strategy 1 is referred to as \emph{GradNeg}; strategy 2 as \emph{GradBoost}; and strategy 3 as \emph{AdaBoost}. 

Each BDT was trained with the same set of input features. The three MVA strategies were trained using the same sample of events to train and test the BDTs. The expected limits and uncertainties for each strategy are shown in Table~\ref{tab:BDTalgos} for the $\mu$ + jets and e + jets final states. Note that this study was performed at an earlier stage in the analysis so the results to do not correspond to the final expected limit given in the analysis in section~\ref{sec:limits}. The BDT output discriminator distribution was only split into \njets categories of of 6, 7, 8, 9+ jets at this stage rather than \njets and \nMtags categories.
 % The response of the signal and background samples as well as the ROC curves for the derived classifiers for each strategy can be seen in Figs. \ref{fig:GradNeg} through \ref{fig:AdaBoost}.



\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Expected limits using jet categories of 6, 7, 8, 9+ jets for different BDT boosting algorithms.}
\label{tab:BDTalgos}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Algorithm & $\mu$ + jets & uncertainty & e + jets & uncertainty \\ \hline
GradNeg   & 18.1         & +8.0, -5.3  & 27.6     & +12.9, -8.3 \\ \hline
GradBoost & 18.7         & +8.3, -5.5  & 28.8     & +12.9, -8.3 \\ \hline
AdaBoost  & 10.7         & +6.4, -4.0  & 21.6     & +10.9, -7.0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It can be seen from table~\ref{tab:BDTalgos} that the difference between including negative weight information in the GradNeg stratefy and not including it in the GradBoost strategy make a very small difference to the expected limit. Using GradNeg could be considered to be using a slightly more optimal training of the signal sample but as there is little difference it would be sufficient to use the GradBoost strategy. In this case, if negative weight information is not used then one can use the AdaBoost strategy. This strategy does provide a significant benefit in lowering the expected limit, therefore it was the choosen algorithm to proceed with in this analysis.

\section{Studies of additional MC samples ~\label{app:altsamples}}


\subsection{Comparison of Madgraph aMCatNLOFxFX generator for ttbar}

It can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:MGFXFX} that the uncertainty from the Madgraph aMCatNLOFxFX generator is well within the uncertainty from the Madgraph MLM generator, therefore it is conservative to use the Madgraph MLM generator as the systematic shape for differences in the BDT distribution due to generator choice.

\end{figure} 


\subsection{TTZ, TTW, TTH MC backgrounds~\label{app:TTX}}
The contributions from \ttbar + X, where X = W, Z or H, are added to the predicted \ttbar yields to give a prediction for the net \ttbar + X background. The event-level BDT discriminant shapes for these contributions closely follow those of the \ttbar contribution and are very different from those predicted for the \tttt signal as a function of both the number of jets and the number of b-tagged jets. The differences are small and they over covered by the quoted \ttbar scale uncertainties so no additional systematic uncertainties are needed to cover these backgrounds.

\section{Combination with OS dilepton channel and SS dilepton channel}

The sensitivity of the search for standard model four top quark production can be improved by combining with other search channels. An opposite-sign (OS) search was developed in parallel with the single lepton channel study described in this chapter~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-16-016}. The analysis selects on events which contain any combination of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, $\mu^{\pm} e^{\mp}$, $e^{+}e^{-}$. It uses the same hadronic top quark reconstruction as in Section~\ref{sec:topContent13} to identify the BDT value for highest-ranked top quark candidate, $BDT_{trijet1}$. This variable is fed into the event-level BDT along with other variables based on the event-topology, event activity and b-jet content. A simultaneous fit was made using the BDT histogram templates described above for the single lepton channel and the BDT histogram templates (which are split only in \njets categories due to statistical limitations) from the dilepton channel. All systematic uncertainties apart from the lepton scale factors were treated as correlated. The results of this fit can be found in table~\ref{tab:limits_combined} in the row labelled \emph{Combined (single lepton and OS dilepton)}. It is clear that the OS dilepton channel alone is not as sensitive as the single lepton channel, which is due in part to it having a smaller branching ratio, however it's combination with the single lepton channel improves the overall sensitivity.\\

The analysis was then further combined with a search for new physics in events with same-sign (SS) dileptons which places limits on the standard model production of four top quarks~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kod}. This search benefits from very low numbers of events from background processes which gives rise to it's good signal sensitivity. The luminosity, JES and PU systematic uncertainties were treated correlated between the SS dilepton channel and the other two channels. The uncertainty in response of the CMS trigger system to events containing dileptons is was also treated as correlated between the two dilepton analyses, whilst all other systematic uncertainties were treated as fully uncorrelated between the SS dilepton analysis and the other two search channels. The combination of all channels is listed in Table~\ref{tab:limits_combined} where it can be seen that this gives a significant improvement in the expected limit compared to any individual channel.
